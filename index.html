# Gabe's movie-web Selfhost is Shutting Down
## Why?
This selfhost was created to circumvent movie-web's primary media provider, Showbox, deciding to block movie-web's hosting server, Cloudflare. Because this selfhost is deployed through Netlify, which is not blocked by Showbox, Showbox could be used freely. While this was superior to using the [public version of movie-web](https://movie-web.app), some downsides still clearly existed when using a selfhost rather than the original site.<br>
The movie-web team has since launched the movie-web Chrome extension, which handles source providers without using Cloudflare and is much more efficient and reliable than previous versions of the public movie-web or Gabe's selfhost.<br>

## How can I use browser extensions on my phone?
### iOS & iPadOS
Using Chrome extensions on iOS and iPadOS can be accomplished with the [Orion Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orion-browser-by-kagi/id1484498200), which runs on the same WebKit base technology as Safari and shares a very similar interface.<br>
Simply install Orion from the App Store and click the link above to install the extension.<br>
Orion has been thoroughly tested by Gabe since its closed-beta launch in 2021.<br>
### Android
There are several desktop-extension-supporting browsers for Android on Google Play and other third party repositories, find one that works for your needs.<br>
